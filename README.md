# Hash Array Mapped Tries

<p align="center">

This library contains: 

- a [reimplementation](#persistenthashmap-port) of Clojure's PersistentHashMap in Clojure
- [visualization tools](#visualizing-hamts) for the underlying trie.
- a [draft paper](#paper) that gives a from-scratch tutorial
  on hash array mapped tries.
- a [prototype](#keyword-map-optimizations) for dynamically generated `defrecord`s
  based on runtime key frequency.

It was completed as part of the B503 Algorithms graduate course
at Indiana University Bloomington (Fall 2016).
It was also just a great excuse to learn all this stuff.
